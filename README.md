## Fork of the [pear/Numbers_Words] with [composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) support

This repository just provides a proxy to the PEAR Numbers_Words library with the required files to make it compatible with Composer (see [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org))

## example

{{'2'|number_to_word}} gives 'two'.
